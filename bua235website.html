<li>I have made a friend group at work, consisting of people my age, a year older, and a year younger. We're all from various towns on the south shore of Boston. We are all very close; We hangout outside of work, and we always have fun when we work together.</li>
<li>I work almost every day in the summer, making as much money from the minimum-wage-paying job as possible.</li>
<li>Having experience in a restaurant, I hope to work in an actual, busy restaurant when I'm older.</li>
