<li>I love performing, whether it be in a play, musical, or just being onstage and having fun.</li>
<li>Musical theater has been a passion of mine for about 5 years now.</li>
<li>I realized that it's a dream of mine to be on Broadway since January 2015 when I saw the Broadway show "Kinky Boots".</li>
<li>I love long car rides where we sing (and attempt to dance) to music without having a care in the world.</li>

<li>To coincide with performing and acting, I have always had an interest in movies. Whether it be in front of the camera or behind the scenes, filmography is very interesting to me.</li>
<li>I have a weird obsession with rollercoasters. The science of how tall and fast they can go and how they manage to keep riders safe while doing their flips and turns has always fascinated me. Fun fact, I have these random periods where I bingewatch rollercoaster vides on YouTube.</li>
<li>I love to eat, but I am a very picky eater.</li>
<li>I love photography and photo editing.</li>
<li>Listening to and creating music with my friends is one of my favorite hobbies.</li>
<li>The world amazes me with its beauty, and I hope to get the chance someday to explore it.</li>
<li>Social media plays a big role in my life. Whether it be interacting with friends online or catching up on popular social networkers/celebrities, social media leaves an impact on my day to day life.</li>
